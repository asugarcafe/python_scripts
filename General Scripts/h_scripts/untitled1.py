I am more than my physical body
Because I am more than physical matter, 
I can perceive that which is greater than the physical world.

Therefore, I deeply desire:
to expand, to experience, to know, to understand, to control, 
and to use such greater energies and energy systems 
as may be beneficial and constructive to me 
and to those who follow me

Also, I deeply desire the help and cooperation, 
the assistance, and the understanding 
of those individuals 
whose wisdom, development, and experience 
are equal to or greater than my own

I ask for their guidance and protection 
from any influence or any source 
that might provide me with less than my stated desires
