#abstract: another mental kungfu technique to program
in with hypnosis/NLP. 

mental metaphor: a crow hiding treasure is trying 
    to not lose anything and make everything useful later.
    mentally sorting incoming data using mnemonic techniques to ensure recall
    crow future paces when it will need the treasure later and its only useful 
    if the treasure can be found. The crow marks where the treasure is hidden
    so it can be found later.

Focus: Crow recognizes treasure.
Location: Crow prepares location to store the treasure.
Coding: Crow wraps treasure in a unique bag.
Action: Crow flies the wrapped treaure to the location.
Recall: Crow retrieves the treaure again and again.

States/Syntaxes:
    -Recognize something needing storage
    -Sort where to store the information by when/where it will be needed later
        --future pace
            --when might you need it? who needs it now?
            --what future situations will be better because you remember this?
        --how is it useful to people now? how will it be useful to you in the future?
        --how important will this be when you need it?
    -cement the information using a mnemonic, 
        --action + relevence + emotion + sensory immersion
