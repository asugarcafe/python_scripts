Ok, just make yourself comfortable now.|15|
if you want to close your eyes, that's a good idea, but if you don't, that's fine too.|15|
now you can just listen quietly to the sound of my voice.|15|
and of course you'll be aware of all those other sounds, too.|15|. sounds inside the building, sounds from outside.|15| but these won't disturb you.|15| In fact they are going to help to relax you, because the only sound you need to think about is the sound of my voice.|15| and while you're listening to the sound of my voice you can just simply allow yourself to be as lazy as you could ever want to be.|15|. Just allow yourself to be as lazy as you could ever want to be.|15|Good.|15| now, while you're relaxing there in the chair, you can just be aware of your body.|15| aware of your hands where they rest on the arms of the chair.|15| perhaps noticing the angle of your elbows and maybe sensing the weight of your head against the chair back.|15| and, you know, that weight might seem to just gently increase as you allow yourself to relax more and more.|15| just being aware of your ankles and feet now, on the footrest, and wondering if they will start to feel heavy too, as you.|15| relax.|15| thinking about your breathing for a few moments.|15| noticing that your breathing is becoming slower and steadier as you relax more and more.|15| slower and steadier.|15| breathing so steadily and evenly.|15| just as though you were pretending to be sound asleep.|15| breathing so evenly, so steadily.|15| you almost wouldn't disturb a feather placed immediately in front of you.|15| breathing so easily and slowly, so gently, that you almost wouldn't disturb even a single strand of a feather placed right in front of you.|15|.

And as you allow yourself to relax even more now.|15| I wonder if you can perhaps sense the beating of your own heart.|15| sensing the beat of your own heart and just seeing whether you can use the power of your mind to slow that heartbeat down.|15| just a touch.|15| just seeing whether you can use the power of your mind to slow that heartbeat down just a little.|15| so that you can then feel your whole body slowing down.|15| becoming lazier and lazier.|15| because you've got absolutely nothing whatsoever to do except to relax now.|15| nobody wanting anything, nobody expecting anything.|15| so you can allow your whole body to continue to relax and become steadier and easier until it's just ticking over.|15| like a well maintained machine of some sort or another.|15| just ticking over.|15| smoothly.|15| easily.|15| quietly.|15| comfortably.|15| so that you can become gradually more aware of your whole self.|15| aware of your hands and arms, just sensing how they are now.|15| aware of your legs and feet, too.|15| again just sensing how relaxed they might be, and wondering if it's possible to relax them even more.|15| to be so in touch with yourself that you can actually get your whole body, perhaps, to relax even more.|15| yet remaining totally alert.|15| and noticing now how even your face muscles can begin to really relax.|15| relaxing and letting go of the tensions that were there, almost, but not quite, completely unnoticed.|15| just being vaguely aware of the skin and the muscles of your face settling.|15| smoothing out.|15| a good feeling.|15| wondering just how long all that tension had been there.|15| where it all came from in the first place.|15| and then realising that you simply couldn't care less.|15| because you can feel it draining away from you now.|15| and that feels good.|15| and as you continue to sense the beating of your heart and the absolute steadiness of your body's rhythm.|15| you wonder at the fact that you are so absolutely relaxed and comfortable that you simply can't be bothered to even try to move even one single muscle.|15| even though you know you easily could.|15| if you wanted to.|15| I know that you easily could, if you wanted to.|15| but you simply can't be bothered to even try.|15| allowing yourself to just be.|15| relaxed and relaxing even more now.|15| as lazy and relaxed as anyone could ever wish to be.|15| and I wonder if you can now manage to relax even more.|15| even though you are already as relaxed as it is possible for most people to ever be.|15| just finding the last tiny traces of tension in your body and simply letting them go.|15| with each easy, gentle, breath you breathe.|15| allowing every muscle.|15| every fibre.|15| every cell of your entire body.|15| to be as beautifully relaxed as anyone could ever wish to be.|15|
