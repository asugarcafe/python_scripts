But instead of being greeted by the members of my crew they acted as though I were suspicious and asked me my business. At first, I thought they were having a jape and continued towards the warehouse offices. But, the men Ive known, and mostly trusted, for the past two years bullied up on me and told me to heel-toe back where I came from. After a few minutes of hot talk they still weren''t breaking the game so I pressed them that the jape wasnt funny anymore and we had work to do. I had to hold myself back from breaking Champs''s finger (especially because he''d break mine back,) when he poked it into my chest, told me he didn''t know me, never met me, and said to high-tail it or I''d get his shoe-polish on my teeth. Rather than risk breaking up the crew over a few split lips and hurting everyones feelings I backed off and went to the nosh to get a cup of joe and the breakfast I normally took after reviewing the days numbers. I needed to figure out what their game was.' +
'\nAt the diner, Daisy the waitress seemed to be playing at the same game when I ordered the usual. She cheerily replied "And what would be the usual for you, Darlin?". This took me back because I''d been ordering the same hash and egg plate every day for the last nine months. When I asked what Daisy was playing at I started to get a sinking feeling. Daisy just stared back at me with an empty expression. Daisy was easy on the eyes but not bright enough to hold to a jape this long without breaking. Sighing, I ordered a coffee and the hash and egg plate. As Daisy turned to give the order to the cook I sunk back into the booth. Something was definitely wrong.' +
'\nAfter finishing my breakfast, I went to the washroom to clean up, take my morning duece, and check my face in the mirror to make sure I am who I am.')

'\n[Story Direction - Something Happens: A con-man has set up a table in the main street and is selling some truly bizarre items.

I crossed to watch his game. Upon closer inspection I saw that he was selling wares. Looking over his table I noted these weren''t the usual items a burglar or thief (which he had to be,) would sell on the open street. His wares seemed to be religious in nature, though not of any religion of which I was familiar. They seemed acient and of primitive craftsmanship. The seller, seemed nervous and in a hurry to move the wares. He even offered to cut his price by half when I showed interest in clay and wood model of what looked like the viking boats I''d learned about while visiting an exhibit at the museum of science. Though not usual interested in such things, I was dating a bird at the time who loved museums and dragged me all over the city to every show she could find. Not usually a history buff, as a man who spends a lot of time at sea, I found the viking''s seamanship admirable.' +

[Mo IMTIMIDATE 27 success] I jumped back and threw my hands up. The pretty laday and her monkey Moe werent going to be of any help. For a second I thought of flashing the gun to let the giant mook I didnt appreciate the threat. But, I thought better of it and just apologized to both of them. "Listen, Im sorry. Im looking for someone very important to me and I think they might be on this island. Im going be looking around. If we happen to meet again please dont think it was on purpose."

But since I heard the screaming there as well I just got low, tried to cover my ears from the din and watch for what my be causing such a terrible distress. I pulled out the .38 Long but had no idea where to point it so I kept it hidden under my coat! The screaming seemed louder than a normal human seemed capable of, and while the screaming might be feminine I didnt think it soulnded like the nature buff, (or her gorilla,) that Id met down at the bay.')
