Corinda: And lastly, talking about you, I suppose you have played theatres and music halls?
Claude: I suppose I've played almost every theatre in the British Isles. Corinda: And today, I believe I'm right in saying you do quite a bit of producing and you are also the Vice-President of The Magic Circle.
Claude: Quite true.
Corinda: Well now, Claude, what I want to do is to ask you some questions that I think will help readers of this book to understand more the acting side of show business. Most of my questions are drawn from a lecture you gave recently on stage craft and acting, and having made some notes at the time I would ask you now to give us more detail. In general, we are concerned with points of interest to Mentalists as you realise this book specialises on that subject.

Claude: I'd like to break in there and say I don't think it matters what you are doing-if you are giving a stage performance, whether you are a comedian or a Mentalist, a magician or any form of stage performer, you are employing the art of the actor and the better actor you are the better performance you are going to give to further your medium.
Corinda: This prompts me to ask you whether the same principles apply for stage as for close up?
Claude: Yes. Let us talk from the stage point of view, it's easier to talk that way. But the same principle applies wherever there is entertainment. If you have mastered the technique for stage you can apply those principles anywhere even a drawing room.
Corinda: I remember the first thing you spoke about was deep breathing. At the start I thought it was unimportant-but half way through your lecture you had me convinced I was wrong.
Claude: Yes. Although it seems a strange thing to say if you do learn the simple process of deep breathing, it can be a great help; I will try and describe it briefly to you. You take air in through the nostrils and fill the lungs and then expel the air out of the mouth. The way to do it is to empty the lungs, one thinks for deep breathing that you have to fill the lungs, but the important thing is to empty them first of all-because you can't fill them up with fresh air if you've left some stale air in there. Fill up by taking it slowly through the nostrils and breathe it out slowly through the mouth. But as you take in, tighten up all your muscles, grip your hands, and flex your arm and shoulder muscles and as you let the air come out, relax everything.
Now I didn't describe in the lecture until later on the use of deep breathing -but I think it best if we do that now in this case.
Corinda: Yes, please do or readers may well think you are talking a lot of nonsense.
Claude: Well, if you have mastered deep breathing, that is to say, you must practise it a bit, you cannot do it suddenly-it has to be acquired, you will find that one of its great values is when you are standing in the wings waiting to go on. There is nothing for you to do, everything is ready and all you do is to stand there and feel more and more nervous. Now deep breathing apart from the good it does you, will steady your nerves, gives the blood oxygen and gives you something to do, something to mildly occupy your mind just at that time when you are at the height of your nervousness waiting to go on. You will find it is a most valuable thing at that particular time.
Corinda: If I can pop another question here. Later you will be speaking about voice control, I believe I'm right in saying that you said there is an important connection between deep breathing and voice production?
Claude: Yes. That is another use which we shall discuss presently. Corinda: Right. Let us leave that for further discussion later on and start now at the beginning of a performance. Can we ask you for tips for making an entry on to the stage. What is the right approach?
Claude: Yes, before I deal with that, I should say that an actor looks upon everything he does as playing a character. And it can be very helpful to mentalists if you think of yourself as playing a part. It's a bit like the ordinary individual at a part; dress him up and he behaves in a manner according to his dress or character. You will find that if you have formulated in your own mind that you are playing a part-you are the Mentalist or whatever you want to be, you step into that character and its almost like putting on a disguise. You will be less nervous if you do that.
Corinda: Well Claude, in your opinion what character is a Mentalist. I mean, how can you tell so that you can portray that?
Claude: No. Simply form in your own mind a character, whatever you feel you would like to be on the stage. Your stage character may be just that little bit different to you. You may feel that when you want to walk across a room you like to slouch across; but in your own mind, you feel that the sort of man you would like to be on the stage is not a man who slouches so you cultivate for that character a more upright walk or a better walk. Maybe a more commanding appearance or manner, something a little more dynamic than you have in the ordinary way. It is a character, something a little different to yourself.
Corinda: Would you say it was wrong for mentalists to create a belief in himself to the extent that during his act he actually believes he can do that sort of thing?
Claude: I would say that it was essential for the mentalist to do it. As long as you bear in mind it's not playing a part in a play where you can make all sorts of exaggerated statements, here you must be careful that you do not overdo it and land yourself in trouble. Mentally-if you are playing a part you should believe you have these powers-that's the actor.
Corinda: Can we return to our earlier question about walking on. Claude: One important thing to bear in mind is to stand well back. Don't stand close to the wings so that your first step brings you right on to the stage. Get well back off stage so that when it's your time to appear, you take at least three or four, or even more steps before anybody sees you. Then you are well walking, travelling at a good speed by the time the audience see you. Don't appear as though you have jumped out of the wings.
Another important thing there. As you walk on, look at your audience. Directly you get on to the stage, look at them. The power of the human eye is amazing and if you don't look at them you look a fool. We might say that's a golden rule.
Corinda: So to sum it up, stand well back to arrive on stage at a good walking speed and as you come on turn your head to face the audience. Then where do you go?
