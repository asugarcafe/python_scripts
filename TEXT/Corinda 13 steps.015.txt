Claude: You arrive centre stage normally.
Corinda: You mentioned the danger of standing too far forward on the stage because the footlights can make you look funny.
Claude: True. Take a reasonable distance, depending on the stage and your set up of props and what you have got. I would say as far as you can say, if you keep a few feet from the footlights without falling over your props you will be all right. It is very bad to stand on top of the footlights and you should always try and avoid it.
Corinda: When we were speaking just now about looking at an audience, I meant to ask you more about that. In your lecture you described how to do this.
Claude: Many beginners and often really experienced people fail to know how to look at an audience. Some people will tell you to look over their heads, to look here, to look there... the actual secret is that you look in the direction of the audience, but you do not focus, you do not allow your eyes to focus on any particular thing or any particular person. Then you will give the impression that you are speaking and looking at everybody. Your eyes casually move around up into the gallery or circle and down again. Never look directly at any one person-an actor doesn't look at the audience because he is playing a part. If you are in a scene or a play, you don't look at the audience, they are the " Fourth Wall." On the other hand, as an entertainer walking on to address an audience, then you are going to speak to the audience and so you do look at them.
Corinda: What happens in the case of some theatres where the lighting conditions make it almost impossible to see the audience?
Claude: You look in the right direction just the same and the audience will not know you cannot see them. It makes no difference.
Corinda: Can we get on to a very important subject-that of Voice Production, correct speech and talking so that everyone can hear you.
Claude: Well of course, it's a big subject. One can take elocution and have your voice trained and that sort of thing, but broadly speaking first of all is the correct production of the voice, what is known as a " Forward Production" and that means the voice must be pitched just behind the front top teeth. Pitch the voice forward and not down in the throat. A good way to assist you, if you don't think you have a forward voice is to use what is called the nasal voice-that is talking through the nose; if you do that, and then leave the nose open, you will find the voice is in that forward position.
Corinda: People usually believe that if you get on a stage and talk to the back row of an audience, everybody must hear you, would you say this is correct?
Claude: Yes. Definitely. If you feel that you are talking to someone who is sitting in the back row it will work. But be careful not to shout. Again it comes back to deep breathing. You have a good lung capacity and you can hold a lot of air, and you can conserve air. The more air you get behind your words, the more force you can give them without shouting. Corinda: There was a tricky point in your lecture where you were forced to show that you could perform deep breathing on stage without visibly blowing yourself out in view of the audience.
Claude: No. You do the deep breathing in the wings before you get on stage but it can still be done gently whilst actually on stage.
Corinda: And you had something to say about speaking good English and not clipping off the ends of words.
Claude: Yes you get that in Elocution. One of the things they teach you is to sound your consonants clearly. Also, not to clip off the endings of words -finish a word. You would be surprised, if some of our entertainers could make tape recordings and listen carefully to what they are saying, they would be very surprised to hear how many of the endings of their words they clip off. In a big hall or theatre it means that those words just don't get over. Pronounce your words clearly and finish them.
Corinda: Do you vary the volume of your voice according to the size of the place in which you are performing?
Claude: Yes. Obviously you must do so. To go to an extreme, you may be performing in open air. Due to inexperience you may find yourself inclined to shout; if you would only realise that you can be heard in the open air as long as you speak clearly and distinctly. In a hall or theatre there is always a certain amount of vibration which brings the sound back to you so you can hear yourself speaking. In the open air your voice seems to disappear and you worry, thinking you are not being heard. Always try to avoid shouting.
Corinda: Now to change the topic again, I remember you said the hardest thing for an actor to do is to stand still on the stage. What can you add to that?
Claude: True. Many an actor finds it extremely difficult to stand still on the stage. The secret is to plant your weight firmly on both feet, don't have your weight on one foot. Let your arms hang by your side and relax. If you put your arms by your sides and your muscles are stiff, it will betray any nervousness and you won't look at ease. You must relax completely. Corinda: Why do you consider it important that an actor or mentalist does stand still?
Claude: I think that it's important to stand still because when you do move it has dramatic effect. If you are constantly moving about it serves no purpose, it becomes monotonous and you lose people's attention. If you stand still as you should do when you are talking to an audience, then, when you do move, it is definitely dramatic.
Corinda: In your lecture you mention quite a bit about bad habits concern- ing movement on stage. Can we speak about them?
Claude: That was the various things you can do through nervousness. The sort of things that people do, not knowing they are doing them as a result of nerves. A common habit is nodding the head in emphasis and another Is shifting the weight from one foot to another. People don't realise it but eventually they form almost a rocking movement which is most irritating and means the performer lacks repose. Another bad habit is to gradually wander forward a little bit and then wander back. Again you see you have unnecessary movement.
Corinda: I have another note on your comment that an actor never does anything on stage unless he knows that he does it. What did that mean? Claude: It is a very hard thing for the inexperienced performer to grasp. A trained actor is in complete command of himself. Every intonation of his voice and every muscle of his body, every look in the eye and all he does is known to himself. He does not do anything on the stage without knowing
