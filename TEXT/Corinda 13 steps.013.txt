INTRODUCTION 
AN INTERVIEW WITH CLAUDE CHANDLER

Claude Chandler, now Vice-President of the London Magic Circle has, spent a lifetime on the stage. As actor, magician, producer and writer he is well qualified to give advice; we attended a lecture given by Claude on the subject of Acting on the Stage and the Importance of Production and Presentation. In our humble opinion, this lecture was brilliant and we were so impressed with the practicability of it all, that we arranged for him to come to our Studio and tape record an interview on the subject of Stage acting and Production for the benefit of our readers. Like the Interview with Fogel in Step Seven, it is considered that a great deal of advice can be given and taken by these cross-question interviews. It may be pointed out that Claude Chandler is not a Mentalist. But those of you who have worked on any type of stage will readily agree that no matter who you are or what you are, Production and Acting counts one hundred per cent. If you learn to be an Actor you can play any role and a Mentalist is simply one role; therefore let us leave you to learn from the experience of a man who can act.

THE ACTOR By Claude Chandler

Corinda: We start off Claude by asking you a little bit about your personal career in show business, how long you have been at it and what sort of places you have played in your time.
Claude: Well, I'm not a Mentalist of course although any actor could play the role of Mentalist; as you know, I am a professional magician and ventriloquist. I wouldn't like to say how far back I go!
Corinda: Well how many years have you been at it?
Claude: Ever since I was a boy at school-and that's quite a while. I've done a great deal of private entertaining of course, and worked in the days when you went to the lovely country houses of England and most of the Theatres and music halls in the country.
Corinda: Interrupting you there Claude, I suppose it is worth mention that you have played Royal Command Performances?
Claude: I don't think that's the most interesting-I have worked for members of the Royal Family but I think the most interesting thing from magicians and mentalists points of view is the fact that when I was a young man, and the great and famous David Devant finally realised that through illness he would never perform again, he actually chose me to carry on with his work. I didn't know him, he saw me performing and asked me to come and see him and the outcome was I presented nearly all his most famous illusions in a show that ran for nearly an hour and a quarter. The Artists dream and the Golliwog ball, all the wonderful things that were his, which I performed for a number of seasons at Maskelynes and I suppose that is the most interesting thing in my career from a conjuring point of view. Needless to say, Devant himself was an Actor and I've always been extremely interested in Acting which brings us to the subject of this interview.
Corinda: Would you say you learnt a lot from Devant as an actor? Claude: I don't think I learnt anything directly from him as an actor except of course that he was a very accomplished actor and he always mixed with actors and understood the value of acting, in magical presentation. Corinda: May I ask you did you learn your acting from an acting school or did you learn it by experience, by constantly being at it?
Claude: I learnt it from experience, I never went to a school of acting, but I made a study of it; I've always studied acting and considered it, thought about it and read about it. Everything I could do, I did to find out about acting and the art of the actor. Then I learnt to apply it to magic as I think many people ought to do.
Corinda: How would you advise somebody who was interested in making a study of acting-what would you recommend to them. Should they go to a school?
Claude: Well, they can go to a school of acting of course, it's an excellent thing and if they can do it, although it is rather difficult and takes a long time, it is a wonderful thing for them. It would not be money or time wasted if they wanted to go in for magic or mentalism seriously. A course of acting would be a vast step forward. Otherwise, they must just find out what they can about it and study it from whatever point of view they are able.
Corinda: Off hand, can you think of any good book that you could advise to help on this subject.
Claude: No I don't think there is any special book for me to recommend. There are books undoubtedly published and many are to be found in every library.
Corinda: I believe I'm right in saying that in your career you have indeed done several Royal Command performances.
Claude: Yes, I have on a number of occasions because, as I say, I used to work to people referred to as landed gentry and on many occasions, Royalty were there. This includes our present Queen and her family.
