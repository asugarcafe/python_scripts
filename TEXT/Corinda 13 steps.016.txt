he does it and the danger with so many of our performers-many that I have seen in magical societies, is that they have so many bad habits and they do things not knowing they are doing them. You can do whatever you like on the stage-it may not be successful, which is a matter of trial and error, if you want to do your Mentalism standing on your head, you can-if you wish, but you should know that you're doing it! You can do it on one foot if you like the awful thing is the man that does it on one foot and doesn't know he's standing on one foot.
Corinda: A complication occurs to me listening to you Claude. You say that it's important that an actor knows about everything he does, his speech and movement, does that mean a person must watch himself whilst perform- ing. How can a performer overcome the difficulty of watching himself and not paying enough attention to the audience?
Claude: Well, it's a curious thing and I suppose it only comes by long training or long experience. There is an essential difference between the inexperienced performer and the experienced performer, be he actor or any other form of entertainer. The experienced performer constantly thinks of the audience, he sees everything via the eyes of the audience. The inexperi- enced performer is constantly thinking what he's doing. "I'm walking on a stage, I'm picking up this, I'm standing here, etc...." he can't help it, even he would change with experience to the professional attitude..." the audience see me walking on a stage, they see me picking this up, it's having this effect on them..." all the time, the effect on the audience as they see it.
One must stand outside oneself and learn to look at oneself and see what is going on.
Corinda: Speaking about stage movement, you gave some useful advice on the right way to walk on stage.
Claude: An actor is taught to walk the stage for an example, a mentalist stands in the middle of the stage. He has to turn up stage towards a table, pick up something and return to the centre of the stage. Now if you turn round and approach that table and bring your feet together-you cannot get back to the centre without a lot of shuffling of your feet. If you arrive at the table with what we call the upstage foot (that's the foot furthest away from the audience) with your weight on it, and the downstage foot is more or less allowed to hang behind, in that position, you find you can turn and come back with almost no movement of your feet. It is difficult to describe but if you try, you will find that if you bring your feet together you can't turn round and start off back again without an awful lot of shuffling. That's the kind of thing one learns in walking the stage.
Corinda: Dealing more with movement, what would you say is dramatic movement?
Claude: I think almost anything that he hasn't done constantly, is dra- matic movement for the mentalist. It brings me back to my point, if a man is constantly walking back and forth there's nothing startling in any move- ment he may do. But if he's been standing still for quite a time and he suddenly moves and turns upstage, that sudden movement can be arresting. Any gesture or movement that is done fairly quickly and held can be dramatic. Another example. If you point your finger to someone in the audience, or straight out into the audience, and stand there pointing it's bound to be dramatic as long as it has some bearing.
Corinda: Let us leave this now and change to another topic. What would you say are some common faults with patter?
Claude: The outstanding fault is not learning patter. Patter should be learnt and I think the mentalists are probably the greatest offenders. A mentalist has to do so much explaining and the whole of his script should be edited with the greatest of care so that he has an economy of words, otherwise it gets lost and fogged with verbosity. I would say a vital thing is to write out your patter first and learn it after some editing has been done. Get it clear and concise. I've seen many a good mental performer fail because the audience don't quite know where they are with this awful jumble of words.
Corinda: I feel I should point out in defence of Mentalists, that we have to use what is called spiel-very often an almost impromptu fill-in of patter. Claude: There we have the peculiarity of this subject-so you allow patches in your script which are there for the purpose of ad libbing or spiel. The other points should be linked up by definite patter.
Corinda: I gather that you think the average mentalist uses too much patter?
Claude: Not too much. It seems overburdening because he hasn't got it cut down-he could say all he has to say with less words. A mental act is bound to be very wordy so let's get it as clear and concise as we possibly can. The only way is to write it out and then edit it.
Corinda: Can you offer any tips on how to learn patter?
Claude: An old dodge is to read it over before you go to sleep-any actor will tell you that. Merely read it-no need to keep saying it over to yourself. Remember patter has so many uses and it is therefore important. It can be used as misdirection, it is not what you do, but what you make the audience think you do and patter can help you to achieve that.
Corinda: Now what about props-you mentioned the importance of planning where you are going to put your stuff on stage.
Claude: It is vitally important. Every prop on stage should have its place. Where it comes from and where it goes to. Moreover, if you have one trick with props that is to be followed by another, it's important to know what you are going to do with the props in between. If you need time to get rid of the props from your last trick, start talking about the next one whilst you are putting the props away. It is what we call continuity-things must go on smoothly. You must hold the audience's attention all the time.
Corinda: Well Claude we have covered a pretty wide selection of subjects, but we have yet to deal with the very end of your act. What advice can you offer to our readers concerning curtain calls and exit?
Claude: One very important thing is to check at every theatre to find out which way the tabs close. If you want to make a quick and smooth movement to the front to take your curtain, you must head in the right direction through the tabs. Look up at any time in your act if you have any doubts, and don't leave it too late.
Corinda: In conclusion in your lecture you mentioned some rather important points about having assistants in the act-and the difference between an assistant and partner when it comes to curtain calls.
Claude: Yes, well I did mention that because so many magicians and mentalists do have their wives and friends as assistants, and the point is this
